## Start Here

New extension workflow:

1. Choose the clients and open formats you support
2. Build the plugin, skill, MCP server, app, or agent tool
3. **Validate with [`plugin-scanner`](https://github.com/hashgraph-online/hol-guard)** — recommended local preflight
4. **Add the [HOL scanner GitHub Action](https://github.com/hashgraph-online/ai-plugin-scanner-action)** — recommended for security, optional for listing
5. Ship or submit with confidence

### Quick preflight

```bash
pipx run plugin-scanner lint .
pipx run plugin-scanner verify .
```

### Scanner CI (recommended for security)

Scanner CI is optional for listing. HOL still scans listed projects independently. We recommend including it so MCP servers, skills, plugins, and other agent extensions stay continuously checked — that is how this catalog stays safer for everyone who installs from it. Projects that maintain scanner CI receive the full trust score; projects without it remain eligible and receive a 10% trust-score reduction.

See the full guide: [`SCANNER_GUIDE.md`](./SCANNER_GUIDE.md)  
See contributing requirements: [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md)

The README is the human-readable cross-platform catalog. Machine-readable compatibility exports are available in `plugins.json` and `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` for registry and automation consumers.

### Browse the catalog

Browse the sections below or use the searchable [HOL Plugin Registry](https://hol.org/registry/plugins). Installation varies by client and project, so follow the linked project's setup guide.

This repository is a discovery catalog, not a universal installer. Follow each linked project's instructions for the clients and formats it supports.

## Formats & Development

AI extensions use several overlapping formats. Agent Skills provide reusable instructions, MCP servers expose tools and data, DeepSeek Harness loads Cordis modules/npm packages, and client-specific plugin manifests package those capabilities for installation. Grok Build and Kimi Code each have native plugin manifests and runtime installers. Prefer open formats where practical, then add client adapters for the assistants you support.

### Getting Started

- [Official Docs: Agent Skills](https://developers.openai.com/codex/skills) - The skill authoring format.
- [Official Docs: Build Plugins](https://developers.openai.com/codex/plugins/build) - Author and package plugins.
- [Plugin Structure](https://developers.openai.com/codex/plugins/build#create-a-plugin-manually) - `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` manifest format.

### Codex-Compatible Plugin Anatomy

```
my-plugin/
├── .codex-plugin/
│   └── plugin.json          # Required: name, version, description, skills path
├── skills/
│   └── my-skill/
│       ├── SKILL.md          # Required: skill instructions + metadata
│       ├── scripts/          # Optional: executable scripts
│       └── references/       # Optional: docs and templates
├── apps/                     # Optional: app integrations
└── mcp.json                  # Optional: MCP server configuration
```

### DeepSeek Harness Plugin Anatomy

DeepSeek Harness plugins export a Cordis `apply` function. Installable packages
declare a `dsh.bundle` entry in `package.json`; they do not need a
`.codex-plugin/plugin.json` file.

```ts
import type { Context } from '@deepseek-ai/cordis'

export const name = 'my-plugin'

export function apply(ctx: Context) {
  // Register services, tools, or UI contributions with ctx.
}
```

Install a published package or GitHub package through the DSH profile manager:

```bash
dsh plugin add <npm-package-or-github-spec>
```

### Grok Plugin Anatomy

Grok Build plugins can group skills, commands, agents, hooks, MCP servers, and
LSP configuration. A repository can describe the bundle with an optional
`.grok-plugin/plugin.json` manifest and can publish it through a Grok
marketplace catalog.

```text
my-plugin/
├── .grok-plugin/
│   └── plugin.json          # Optional native manifest
├── skills/                  # Optional Agent Skills
├── commands/                # Optional slash commands
├── agents/                  # Optional subagents
└── .mcp.json                # Optional MCP servers
```

Install a GitHub repository with:

```bash
grok plugin install owner/repo --trust
```

### Kimi Plugin Anatomy

Kimi Code plugins can expose skills, agents, and MCP servers. Current Kimi Code
plugins use `kimi.plugin.json`; earlier plugin bundles may use
`.kimi-plugin/plugin.json` or `plugin.json`. Follow the repository's manifest
and installation instructions.

```text
my-plugin/
├── kimi.plugin.json         # Current Kimi Code manifest
├── skills/                  # Optional skills
├── agents/                  # Optional agents
└── mcpServers/              # Optional MCP server definitions
```

Install a GitHub repository from Kimi Code with:

```text
/plugins install https://github.com/owner/repo
```

### Codex Plugin Creator

Use the built-in skill to scaffold a new plugin:

```
$plugin-creator
```

### Publishing

Distribution varies by client. Most projects publish from a GitHub repository; compatible Codex bundles can also use local marketplaces (`~/.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`) or repo marketplaces (`$REPO_ROOT/.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`). Follow each target client's current packaging and installation documentation.

For this curated list, the README is the editorial source of truth. Generated JSON files provide compatibility exports for registry and automation consumers; they are not a promise that every entry can be installed directly from this repository.

## Validate Before You Ship

After scaffolding with `$plugin-creator`, use [`plugin-scanner`](https://github.com/hashgraph-online/hol-guard) as your quality gate before publishing, review, or distribution.

For skill/plugin authoring workflows, [Codex SkillForge](https://github.com/f0d010c/skillforge) provides an ESLint-style CLI and GitHub Action for scaffolding, linting, smoke-testing, and packaging Codex skills/plugins before publishing.

### Local Preflight

```bash
pipx run plugin-scanner lint .
pipx run plugin-scanner verify .
```

### PR Gate (GitHub Actions)

```yaml
- uses: hashgraph-online/ai-plugin-scanner-action@v1
  with:
    plugin_dir: "."
    fail_on_severity: high
```

### Submission Preflight

Use scanner outputs as evidence for maintainers/reviewers:

- Structural lint results
- Publish-readiness verification output
- SARIF/findings for CI and code scanning

The score is best used as a quick trust signal and triage summary (not the only readiness signal).

## Claim Your Plugin

Verify ownership of your plugin on the [HOL Plugin Registry](https://hol.org/registry/plugins) to display a verified badge on your listing.

### How to claim

1. Go to [hol.org/guard/plugins](https://hol.org/guard/plugins) and sign in with GitHub
2. Find your plugin in the list and click **Verify Ownership**
3. Authorize the read-only GitHub connection (view your profile, email, and public org membership — no write access)
4. Once verified, your plugin listing will display a **Verified** badge

That's it. The verification confirms you are the repository owner or an organization admin. Plugins owned by organizations may require additional review.

> **Note:** You only need to verify once per plugin. If your verification needs to be reset, contact support at `support@hol.org`.

## Plugin Trust Scores

Every plugin in this list is automatically ingested by the [HOL Plugin Registry](https://hol.org/registry/plugins), which runs each through the [`plugin-scanner`](https://github.com/hashgraph-online/hol-guard) to produce a trust score and security analysis.

A snapshot of scored installable plugins (plus modeled Guard runtime fixtures and public advisories) is published on Hugging Face as [HOL Plugin Security](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HashgraphOnline/hol-plugin-security). Scan ≠ safety guarantee. Catalog plugin count is not the Registry Broker agent catalog. HOL publishes it; not independent validation.

Each plugin gets a detailed breakdown across six factors:

- **Installability** - Can the plugin be installed and run without errors?
- **Maintenance** - Is the repo actively maintained with clear documentation?
- **MCP Posture** - How securely are MCP servers configured?
- **Plugin Security** - Does the manifest follow security best practices?
- **Provenance** - Can the publisher's identity be verified?
- **Publisher Quality** - Does the publisher have a track record of quality releases?

You can embed a trust badge in your plugin's README:

```
[![Plugin Name on HOL Registry (Trust Score)](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhol.org%2Fapi%2Fregistry%2Fbadges%2Fplugin%3Fslug%3DOWNER%252FREPO%26metric%3Dtrust%26style%3Dfor-the-badge%26label%3DPlugin+Name)](https://hol.org/registry/plugins/OWNER%2FREPO)
```

Replace `OWNER%2FREPO` with your plugin's GitHub owner and repo name (URL-encoded slash). Metrics available: `trust`, `security`. Styles: `flat`, `flat-square`, `plastic`, `for-the-badge`, `social`.

### HOL Guard Protection Badge

Show that your plugin repo is protected by [HOL Guard](https://hol.org/guard):

```
[![HOL Guard](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhol.org%2Fapi%2Fregistry%2Fbadges%2Fguard%2FOWNER%2FREPO%3Fstyle%3Dflat-square)](https://hol.org/guard)
```

The badge checks your repo for HOL Guard adoption (config files, CI workflows, dependencies) and displays `Protected` (green) or `Unprotected` (grey). To get the badge:

1. Install HOL Guard: `pipx install hol-guard && hol-guard init`
2. Or add the scanner to CI: `uses: hashgraph-online/ai-plugin-scanner-action@v1`
3. Add the badge markdown to your README (replace `OWNER%2FREPO`)

## Plugin Quality

If you received a scanner report on your repo, check the [Scanner Guide](SCANNER_GUIDE.md) for setup instructions, common fixes, and CI setup.

## Contributing

Contributions welcome! Please read the [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) first.

To add a plugin:

1. Fork this repo and add a single line to the appropriate section in `README.md` (alphabetical order)
2. Submit a PR with the plugin repo URL. Scanner CI in the source repository is optional for listing and recommended for security.

**You do not need to copy plugin files into this repo.** A generator fetches your bundle from your source repo and regenerates catalog files automatically.
